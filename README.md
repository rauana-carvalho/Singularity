Visualizing Space Science

Biological experiments conducted in space are essential to scientific discovery efforts, but they are complex to execute and difficult to conceptualize. For example, these experiments must be loaded onto rockets, launched, performed using specialized hardware, and (often) returned to Earth for analysis. This complexity is a barrier to the widespread use of these data. Your challenge is to create a tool that can generate informative and compelling visualizations of biological experiments conducted in space.
