# Singularity - PONT


 **Problem: Visualizing Space Science**

The Pont project was developed to facilitate the visualization of space-based biological data, extracted from experiments such as (OSD-379) and (OSD-665) carried out on the International Space Station. The platform translates complex information into accessible visualizations and allows scientists of different levels of expertise to understand and capture the essence of the experiment in a more intuitive way.
